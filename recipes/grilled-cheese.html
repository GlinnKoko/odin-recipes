        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The classic childhood favorite that still holds up. Pairs well with tomato soup!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 slices bread (white is my favorite, but any type will work)</li>
            <li>2 slices American Cheese</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat skillet to medium, and melt about 1/4 tablespoon butter into the pan (you might need more depending on the size of your skillet)</li>
            <li>With softened butter, spread onto one side of each slice of bread</li>
            <li>Lie one slice of bread butter side down into the skillet, and top with both slices of cheese, and the next slice of bread butter side up.</li>
            <li>once golden brown, flip and cook the other slice of bread</li>
            <li>Once cheese is melted, cut diagonally and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
